## About AI Waifu

AI Waifu is a personalized intelligent companion system that goes beyond a simple "chatbot". It's a high-dimensional intelligent agent that integrates conversational understanding, memory systems, voice/visual interaction, behavior simulation, and character personality. It can understand you, remember you, possess character traits and skills, and proactively execute tasks in its environment.

### Core Capabilities

#### 🗣️ Natural Language Understanding & Emotional Communication

- **Large Language Models (LLM)**: For dialogue generation and semantic understanding
- **Emotion Recognition**: Text/voice emotion classification to adjust response style
- **Character Personality**: Influence language style and emotional expression through Prompt/Persona

#### 🧠 Long-term Memory & Personal Knowledge Graph

- **Vector Database + RAG**: Store semantic memory, combine retrieval-augmented generation for contextually relevant responses
- **Context Manager**: Maintain conversation windows, track topic states, dynamically construct prompts to integrate history with current context
- **Fact Archives**: Build personal and public knowledge graphs (people, events, concepts, relationships) to form a personalized knowledge network
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Short-term memory, long-term memory, memory priority, and decay mechanisms

#### 🎭 Multimodal Interaction

- **Voice Interaction**: Speech recognition (STT) for voice input understanding, text-to-speech (TTS) for natural voice output, supporting end-to-end Speech-to-Speech dialogue
- **Visual & Image Understanding**: Computer vision models to recognize image content, facial expressions, gestures, enabling visual perception and understanding
- **Atomic Actions & Expression Library**: Predefined atomic action system to drive Avatar emotional expressions

#### 🤖 Agent Capabilities & Skills Library

- **Agent Framework**: Implement proactive behavior decision-making and task planning
- **Atomic Skills Library**: Schedule reminders, weather queries, smart device control, data retrieval, API calls
- **Tool Invocation System**: Enable AI to execute commands like an assistant, not just answer questions

#### 🔐 Data Privacy & Personal Sovereignty

- **Local Inference Priority**: Run models and memory banks on user devices
- **Local Storage**: User personalization data stored locally with encryption
- **Open Source & Self-hosted**: An ecosystem driven by individuals and communities, ensuring privacy and freedom
